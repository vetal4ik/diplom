## Quiz 7.x-6.x

*   While 7.x-5.x has an upgrade path from 7.x-4.x, and does not introduce any major API-breaking changes, 7.x-6.x is a completely new architecture not compatible with 5.x.
*   If you have not modified or built upon 4.x or 5.x, chances are you will be able to upgrade to 6.x no problem. Other sites may have issues.
*   6.x will contain all the functionality of 5.x, as covered by the tests.
*   See all the [Change records](https://www.drupal.org/list-changes/quiz) for what to expect.

*   True or false
*   Multiple choice
*   Short answers
*   Long answers
